XML-HSP-Parser
==============
A proof of concept using HTML5 File Reader APIs to parse an uploaded XML file containing results from an NCBI BLASTn search.

I intended for this to be used to feed the data to other javascript applications, such as HighCharts or EBI's BioJS widgets. An example with HighCharts will be forthcoming.

Dependencies: 
jQuery
HTML5 File Reader API Compliant Browser
